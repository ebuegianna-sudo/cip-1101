          People view programming in many ways. To some, it is a niche hobby. To
          others, it is a tool used to earn money aside from solving problems.
          However, programming is not just about building softwares. And being a
          programmer yourself is not just about being able to code.
          <strong
            >Doing it is difficult and many overlook the reason why before
            choosing that path because it is admittedly one of the most
            practical things you can do in today’s society</strong
          >
          having technology as one of its biggest backbones. This blog will
          uncover the layers of what it truly takes to be a real programmer.

            <b>Programmer 1 codes to learn, and Programmer 2 codes to write code</b>,
          however both know how to code. Truly, there are a lot of code
          templates online in which people can paste anytime and anywhere. This
          does not automatically diminish learning. Let college be our scenery
          here. I have observed that this method is very rampant especially to
          those with beginner-level knowledge, and on top of that, they have to
          adjust themselves to strict time constraints school is setting for
          them. With a setting like this, copying and pasting can be resourceful
          at first, but when that becomes a habit, <b>learners might not realize
          that they are slowly carving a path that leads to nothing</b>.
          Requirements may have been passed but there was no real learning
          there. <b>Real programming takes time</b>. It requires showing up frequently,
          exploring more, trying different things, solving small problems at
          times, and testing yourself about what you have learned. It is about
          <b>self-diagnosis</b>, asking yourself what your knowledge gaps are and
          constantly catching up. It is about knowing what it’s like to sit
          through one problem for five hours, all sweaty, and mentally hitting a
          brick wall. Ultimately, it is about <b>resilience</b>, and accepting the fact
          that you will fail over and over again. When all these things come to
          you at once, <b>it is important to think about what you can learn now and
          not criticize yourself for not being the professional programmer you
          want to be yet</b>. That’s just unrealistic. However, I myself fall victim
          to this sometimes hence I try to remind myself just how broad of a
          field programming is. It is hard at first but that is the point. <b>The
          point is to learn enough to make what was once difficult easy</b>, and to
          shape yourself to be the kind of programmer that’s courageous to learn
          pretty much anything.

         <b>Programming requires real commitment</b>. You don’t have to solve every
          arithmetic problem in the world successfully, nor does your progress
          have to be speedy. <b>It is about showing up and developing your passion
          and willingness to learn it despite knowing that it is not the easiest
          thing to do</b>. Programming may be technical, but it also involves heart
          in such a way that you have cared enough to be knowledgeable about it,
          and that you have become the type of programmer that is able to help
          everyone through the means of technology. Whether you are a student or
          an independent learner from home, <b>programming is possible and is a
          challenge that can be overcome as long as real work is present</b>.</p>
