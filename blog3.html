          Majority of society characterize programmers, developers, and
          researchers as total nerds who constantly wear jackets and crunch
          numbers for a living. There is some truth to that, some of them just
          hide it better. As a computer science student,
          <b
            >this course feels like a math major in disguise and a living prison
            as someone who loves too much freedom</b
          >. I have no clear goal for myself yet. Technology just seems so
          robotic. Nurses, doctors, or maybe diplomats save and inspire lives
          which is a fulfilling reason to keep going besides earning money. But
          <b
            >what could be fulfilling about being a person in technology? What
            is human about technology?</b
          >
          I’ve recently realized what could be and what I could be. And I will
          tell you with this story.

      <h3>Purpose Born From a Noble Testimony</h3>

          Recently I attended a funeral. A church-mate of mine died from cancer
          and she was a breadwinner for her family all at the same time. Her
          testimony, the way she lived, truly inspired me and a lot of people
          who knew her. As I sat listening to the preacher talk about her, I
          realized that <b>she is not the only one with this kind of story</b>.
          When I went home, me and my friend talked about it. I asked him
          <b
            >why is it that great inventions like rocket ships, automated cars,
            and artificial intelligence exist, but there is no cure for cancer
            yet. We live in a world where we progress more trying to talk to
            aliens than totally outsmarting cells that turn on us</b
          >. It’s sad, but actually, this tells us just how amazing technology
          actually is because it can do both even if one process is slower than
          the other. Through the means of technology; chemotherapy,
          immunotherapy, and AI-detectors that detect cancer cells before they
          multiply exists now thanks to persevering researchers, developers, and
          biologists. It’s so amazing that if people from 50 years ago look at
          the solutions humans have developed for cancer during modern times,
          <b>to them it would look like a cure—it would look like hope</b>.
          After all, flu was a deadly thing centuries ago. Now, I’m writing this
          blog with a headache and nonstop sniffing. This is me experiencing the
          product of technology in real time, and personally speaking, it’s an
          underrated privilege. And I've come to realize that if ever I choose a
          job, <b>I want to help people experience that same privilege</b>,
          especially in honor to my church mate who did not experience a direct
          cure to her sickness, and to a lot of people experiencing the same
          thing.

          People have always been curious about how the world works, and
          <b>math and science are just tools we use to explore that curiosity</b
          >. Without Thomas Edison, we’d probably still be lighting candles, and
          without the Greeks, we wouldn’t even have trigonometry—the same math
          that helps keep buildings standing today. Even now, researchers are
          still working nonstop to understand and fight cancer. That’s when it
          hit me:
          <b
            >math and science aren’t proof that humans are geniuses, they’re
            proof that humans care enough to keep asking questions</b
          >. Every discovery adds another layer to the world we live in, slowly
          making life safer, easier, and more comfortable.
          <b>Being curious and being helpful are almost the same thing</b>. So
          technology isn’t some cold, robotic field meant only for prodigies or
          unbeatable chess players. At its core,
          <b
            >it’s just people who are curious, persistent, and trying to make
            life a little better</b
          >. And maybe someday I can do the same thing.
