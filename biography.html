      <p>
        My childhood years is a little cloudy in my memory since it is so far
        back in time and I have made a lot of new memories since then. What I
        can recall is that I once lived in Bacoor with my parents and that their
        marriage was not the prettiest. I understood from a very early age that
        the cause of it were things not going according their plan. The way I
        see it, it was a little too early to have a family for both of them. My
        father was still establishing his career and professional growth, and my
        mother had a stable job, however, she had to be a housewife to be able
        to take care of me. On top of that, they had very different
        personalities and values. My father was extremely studious and
        introverted. My mother was a bit more social and she was content with a
        simple life. However,
        <b>she carried the same passion as my dad, but in motherhood</b>. She
        spent a lot of time teaching me to read, write, and do basic mathematics
        which made me qualified to be accelerated from kinder to grade 1 just
        like other kids. Due to this, me and my mother transferred to Cavite to
        continue my education there since my grandmother had a more comfortable
        home and my parents could not be physically near each other without war
        occurring every 5-7 business days. It was the biggest blessing not just
        for them but also for me because my cousin lived in the same house which
        means I have an everyday playmate. Compared to when I was in Bacoor,
        <b>>my playmates were only the construction worker’s daughters</b> and
        they would only come whenever the house had problems which was a weird
        way to have a playmate. Continuing, I gained quite a lot of friends in
        elementary. We were only 15 in class which made us have a strong bond
        until we graduated. Whenever I reminisce about those times, the way we
        talked, fought, and made horror stories about the school’s creepy
        hallways, makes me laugh about how childish it all was.
        <b>It was the least mature version of me but it was the freest</b>.
        <b
          >It is funny how the years where we have the most freedom are the
          years we are least conscious of taking things for granted</b
        >. The problems I experienced during those years are nothing but a small
        grain of sand compared to mountains of academic workload and emotional
        turmoil I am currently experiencing as a college student.
        <b
          >Even if my childhood is vague, I still hold what is clear to me dear
          to my heart and will cherish those memories forever</b
        >.

      </div>
      <p>
        My teenage years are still very clear to me, since in these times, I am
        in high school. These are the years that I frequently look back to
        especially now that I’m in college.
        <b
          >If I was given a choice to choose which chapter of my life I could go
          back to, it would definitely be my teenage years</b
        >. High school was a real turning point for me as a person. I
        experienced academic hardships for the first time—from dissecting
        complex lessons to actually caring about my grades. It is where I first
        felt pressure and feeling like everything I did significantly mattered,
        as if one low grade was the end of the world.
        <b>Thankfully, that is not the case</b>. Looking back, high school was
        nothing more than just training wheels for college, maybe less. However,
        what stuck to me during high school was not academics but my friends.
        Compared to my high school friends, my elementary friends did not last
        long. My high school friends were my first real friends.
        <b
          >With them, I experienced what it was like to confide in somebody, to
          be truly attached to someone, and to consider someone as family even
          if you are not related by blood</b
        >. I enjoyed all the moments I spent with them, hence when the pandemic
        occurred, it felt depressing. I spent most of my time in my room, alone
        with my thoughts, and listening to the music I like. I felt freedom like
        nothing I have ever felt, however, it was lonely and sad as my
        grandfather also died during this time.
        <b
          >I could not help but think whether I took things for granted when I
          was outside while simultaneously longing for experiences I potentially
          missed—like prom</b
        >. A lot of adults say the pandemic stunted our growth, but I do not see
        it that way.
        <b
          >The pandemic taught me to not only stay hygienic, but to find comfort
          in solitude, to evaluate myself as a person, and most importantly, to
          not take things for granted</b
        >. Therefore, when the world went back to normal in my first year of
        senior high school, I promised myself to
        <b
          >enjoy moments, big or small, and to make them count because time is
          fleeting and life is unpredictable</b
        >. Until now, I live with that same principle and will continue to for
        as long as I live.

      <!-- COLLEGE SECTION -->
      <h2 id="college">College</h2>
      <div class="img-block">
        <img src="aboutMe_img/college.jpg" alt="College Years" />
        <div class="caption">College Years</div>
      </div>
      <p>
        <b
          >When a person thinks they have grown enough in high school, they will
          very likely find themselves wrong in their college years</b
        >. College is the border of academics and real life, one step closer to
        work, which is all the more pressuring. I chose computer science even
        with zero knowledge about technology since I realized that being a tech
        person is practical—you are still earning money even if the world is
        facing a global crisis like the pandemic—and on top of that, I also
        heard the pay is good.
        <b>However, I had no idea what I was signing up for</b>. I found myself
        in a room full of math geniuses and students with a hefty tech
        background. For the first time, I felt behind, and I still feel behind
        many times. My friends are two of those smart students, and I feel
        embarrassed asking them a lot of questions, but they are my primary
        source of help, so I have learned to swallow my pride and risk looking
        foolish many times. I have also failed many times, and I cannot help but
        think that my high-school-self would get depressed seeing my grades now.
        But
        <b
          >unfortunately, failure is normal in your typical college experience,
          especially in computer science</b
        >.
        <b
          >Failure strikes your pride and teaches you great things, and I have
          realized that it is ultimately okay to experience failure as long as
          you never repeat your mistakes again</b
        >. Because of this, I also do not tie my worth to academics anymore—not
        as much as I did during high school. It does not mean that I no longer
        value my grades; rather,
        <b
          >my world no longer crumbles when I get a grade that is not up to my
          standards</b
        >. I have learned that learning is forever and it is not limited to a
        certain semester. Maybe I might only fully comprehend the lessons I’m
        encountering during my second year in third year, and to me, that is
        completely fine, or I may only truly understand what I have learned
        during my college years at work. What matters to me now is that I would
        understand the lessons—maybe not in time, but that I eventually would
        and that I did. College experience is very humbling, but so far, it has
        been teaching me a lot. I do not know where I will end up in the future,
        what job I will obtain, or how much pay I will get, but all my actions
        will be driven toward success, and <b>I will ensure it</b>.
