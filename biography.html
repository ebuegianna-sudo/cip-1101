        <p>
          My childhood years is a little cloudy in my memory since it is so far
          back in time and I have made a lot of new memories since then. What I
          can recall is that I once lived in Bacoor with my parents and that
          their marriage was not the prettiest. I understood from a very early
          age that the cause of it were things not going according their plan.
          The way I see it, it was a little too early to have a family for both
          of them. My father was still establishing his career and professional
          growth, and my mother had a stable job, however, she had to be a
          housewife to be able to take care of me. On top of that, they had very
          different personalities and values. My father was extremely studious
          and introverted. My mother was a bit more social and she was content
          with a simple life. However,
          <b>she carried the same passion as my dad, but in motherhood</b>. She
          spent a lot of time teaching me to read, write, and do basic
          mathematics which made me qualified to be accelerated from kinder to
          grade 1 just like other kids. Due to this, me and my mother
          transferred to Cavite to continue my education there since my
          grandmother had a more comfortable home and my parents could not be
          physically near each other without war occurring every 5-7 business
          days. It was the biggest blessing not just for them but also for me
          because my cousin lived in the same house which means I have an
          everyday playmate. Compared to when I was in Bacoor,
          <b>my playmates were only the construction worker’s daughters</b> and
          they would only come whenever the house had problems which was a weird
          way to have a playmate. Continuing, I gained quite a lot of friends in
          elementary. We were only 15 in class which made us have a strong bond
          until we graduated. Whenever I reminisce about those times, the way we
          talked, fought, and made horror stories about the school’s creepy
          hallways, makes me laugh about how childish it all was.
          <b>It was the least mature version of me but it was the freest</b>.
          <b
            >It is funny how the years where we have the most freedom are the
            years we are least conscious of taking things for granted</b
          >. The problems I experienced during those years are nothing but a
          small grain of sand compared to mountains of academic workload and
          emotional turmoil I am currently experiencing as a college student.
          <b
            >Even if my childhood is vague, I still hold what is clear to me
            dear to my heart and will cherish those memories forever</b
          >.

          My teenage years are still very clear to me, since in these times, I
          am in high school. These are the years that I frequently look back to
          especially now that I’m in college.
          <b
            >If I was given a choice to choose which chapter of my life I could
            go back to, it would definitely be my teenage years</b
          >. High school was a real turning point for me as a person. I
          experienced academic hardships for the first time—from dissecting
          complex lessons to actually caring about my grades. It is where I
          first felt pressure and feeling like everything I did significantly
          mattered, as if one low grade was the end of the world.
          <b>Thankfully, that is not the case</b>. Looking back, high school was
          nothing more than just training wheels for college, maybe less.
          However, what stuck to me during high school was not academics but my
          friends. Compared to my high school friends, my elementary friends did
          not last long. My high school friends were my first real friends.
          <b
            >With them, I experienced what it was like to confide in somebody,
            to be truly attached to someone, and to consider someone as family
            even if you are not related by blood</b
          >. I enjoyed all the moments I spent with them, hence when the
          pandemic occurred, it felt depressing. I spent most of my time in my
          room, alone with my thoughts, and listening to the music I like. I
          felt freedom like nothing I have ever felt, however, it was lonely and
          sad as my grandfather also died during this time.
          <b
            >I could not help but think whether I took things for granted when I
            was outside while simultaneously longing for experiences I
            potentially missed—like prom</b
          >. A lot of adults say the pandemic stunted our growth, but I do not
          see it that way.
          <b
            >The pandemic taught me to not only stay hygienic, but to find
            comfort in solitude, to evaluate myself as a person, and most
            importantly, to not take things for granted</b
          >. Therefore, when the world went back to normal in my first year of
          senior high school, I promised myself to
          <b
            >enjoy moments, big or small, and to make them count because time is
            fleeting and life is unpredictable</b
          >. Until now, I live with that same principle and will continue to for
          as long as I live.

            will very likely find themselves wrong in their college years</b
          >. College is the border of academics and real life, one step closer
          to work, which is all the more pressuring. I chose computer science
          even with zero knowledge about technology since I realized that being
          a tech person is practical—you are still earning money even if the
          world is facing a global crisis like the pandemic—and on top of that,
          I also heard the pay is good.
          <b>However, I had no idea what I was signing up for</b>. I found
          myself in a room full of math geniuses and students with a hefty tech
          background. For the first time, I felt behind, and I still feel behind
          many times. My friends are two of those smart students, and I feel
          embarrassed asking them a lot of questions, but they are my primary
          source of help, so I have learned to swallow my pride and risk looking
          foolish many times. I have also failed many times, and I cannot help
          but think that my high-school-self would get depressed seeing my
          grades now. But
          <b
            >unfortunately, failure is normal in your typical college
            experience, especially in computer science</b
          >.
          <b
            >Failure strikes your pride and teaches you great things, and I have
            realized that it is ultimately okay to experience failure as long as
            you never repeat your mistakes again</b
          >. Because of this, I also do not tie my worth to academics
          anymore—not as much as I did during high school. It does not mean that
          I no longer value my grades; rather,
          <b
            >my world no longer crumbles when I get a grade that is not up to my
            standards</b
          >. I have learned that learning is forever and it is not limited to a
          certain semester. Maybe I might only fully comprehend the lessons I’m
          encountering during my second year in third year, and to me, that is
          completely fine, or I may only truly understand what I have learned
          during my college years at work. What matters to me now is that I
          would understand the lessons—maybe not in time, but that I eventually
          would and that I did. College experience is very humbling, but so far,
          it has been teaching me a lot. I do not know where I will end up in
          the future, what job I will obtain, or how much pay I will get, but
          all my actions will be driven toward success, and
          <b>I will ensure it</b>.
