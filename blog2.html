          Burnout is an inevitable part of being a student—unless one is somehow
          superhuman. People cope in different ways: some overeat, some
          under-eat, and some simply withdraw.
          <b>I cope through an object: my white guitar</b>. It may sound
          materialistic, but this instrument has taught me lessons about
          patience, persistence, and passion that feel almost human.
          <b
            >Over time, it has become more than a tool; it has become a
            companion in navigating the challenges of life and study</b
          >. Looking at my hands now, scarred and callused from hours of
          practice,
          <b
            >I realize just how much they reflect the effort and lessons behind
            every chord I play</b
          >.

      <h3>An Object As A Lifelong Companion</h3>
      <div class="clearfix">

        <p>
          Let me begin by saying, for some reason, my grandmother cherished my
          hands. When I was a little younger than I was, my grandmother would
          not let me wash the dishes, and she says it was to keep my hands
          youthful. She would always compare her hands to mine, pointing out how
          wrinkly hers was. That wish was shattered when my uncle chose to gift
          me a guitar now that I’m in college. Unfortunately, since I’ve owned a
          guitar, the tips of my fingers have become callused and layers of skin
          would willingly un-attach itself from my fingers. I would purposefully
          make my cousins uncomfortable by grazing the tip of my fingers onto
          their arms and they would get chills by how scaly it felt, that’s just
          how bad it is. With the way my hands look, nobody would dare hold
          them, yet ironically, I could play the most romantic songs if I wanted
          to. I have to thank my calluses because playing the guitar became less
          painful.
          <b
            >Whenever I get tired of wrestling with complex concepts—especially
            programming—I just pick it up and play, and somehow, I feel better
            almost instantly</b
          >. Both guitar and programming take practice, but
          <b>guitar feels more rewarding</b> because you can hear your progress
          right away. Press the strings correctly, and it sounds beautiful.
          Programming only really clicks after hours of squeezing out brain
          juice and figuring out some bigger life purpose.

      <h3>Pain As The Counterpart of Passion</h3>
      <div class="clearfix">
        <img src="images2/passion.webp" class="img-right" alt="Passion" />
        <p>
          Even if guitar is seen as a creative hobby, it subtly teaches you
          about life—that
          <b
            >success and satisfaction can only be felt after you’ve endured
            enough pain and learnt enough lessons to experience reward</b
          >. Guitar is supposed to be my little escape, but it doesn’t let me
          fully relax. Even when I play, I still have to keep practicing, keep
          getting better. It’s like life doesn’t really give us a break. Even
          the “fun” things push you to improve, like the universe just wants you
          to keep leveling up. <b>Guitar reminds me that passion matters</b>.
          Even if it hurts, even if it’s frustrating, you keep going—because you
          want it to sound good, because you want to get better at something.
          <b
            >And eventually, you can look at your hands—ugly, callused, maybe a
            little scaly—and think that these very hands worked for it, and
            that’s kind of satisfying</b
          >. That’s what the little things, like guitar, teach you.
